## Introduction

Logic gates are the base of all circuits. They are the simplest form of logic, and each performs one logic operation.  
We use logic operations every day unconsciously. The names of those operations are the words we use in our speech.  
As long as you can do that logic operation using a circuit (doesn't have to use electricity) you have a logic gate, and you can build anything you would otherwise be able to with conventional circuits. 

The values of True and False are often represented as 1 and 0 by boolean algebra, and on truth tables. Truth tables are a way to represent all the states of what a logic gate can have.

## NOT gate

The Not operation is the simplest for of logic. It has 1 input and 1 output. And its output is obtained by inverting the value of the input. That means if you input True it should output False and vice versa.
Example: "not going to the beach" is the inversion of "going to the beach". They represent opposite states.
