## Addition in Decimal

In decimal (base 10) system, addition is a simple process of finding the sum of two or more numbers. For example, 2 + 3 = 5. In decimal system,

## Carry and Sum (1-bit Addition)

In a 1-bit addition, we only consider 2 digits, a carry and a sum. Carry is generated when two 1s are added and the sum is generated by exclusive OR(XOR) operation of the two digits.

## Binary addition using RCA algorithm

Binary addition can be performed using a Ripple-Carry Adder (RCA) circuit. An RCA circuit is a simple circuit that consists of full adders connected in series. Each full adder adds two bits and a carry bit from the previous stage.
